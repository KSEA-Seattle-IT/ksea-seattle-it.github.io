### Session abstract - "The age of AI has begun"

In his March 21st post on GatesNotes, Bill Gates explained why AI is as revolutionary as mobile phones and the internet. He asserted that we are entering into a new era, called “the age of AI”, and shared three key principles for this era. In this session, we will explore how Microsoft, a leading player in the AI space, has integrated AI capabilities into its suite of software offerings, empowering both consumers and businesses to harness the power of AI in practical ways.
Subsequently, we can delve into the history behind Microsoft's investment in OpenAI.com, which ultimately led to the development of ChatGPT3 and ChatGPT4. Finally, we can summarize key takeaways regarding what individuals, including parents and children, can leverage AI-Powered platforms in the era of AI.
