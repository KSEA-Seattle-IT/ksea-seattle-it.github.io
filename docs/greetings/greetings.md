<br>

I am pleased to welcome participants and attendees to Redmond, Washington, for the Korean
American Scientists and Engineers Association (KSEA) 2023 National Mathematics and Science
Competition.

In our rapidly evolving technological world, math and science play an increasingly vital role in
our daily lives. In the past decade alone, science has transformed the way we interact with the
world around us. Here in Washington state, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and
Mathematics) education is critical as we move forward in our 21st century economy.
Competitions like this are excellent opportunities for students to hone these skills.

Washington has a proud history of innovation in STEM fields like aerospace, information
technology, and the life sciences, and I hope that the students participating in this yearâ€™s event
will consider a STEM-related field for their future career path. I encourage these students to
continue pursuing their goals with passion and excellence. I have every confidence that their
dedication will serve them well as they progress through their studies and plan for their future.

Thank you all for coming and please accept my best wishes for a memorable competition.
